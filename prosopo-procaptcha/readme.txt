Upon form submission, the plugin communicates with the [Prosopo Procaptcha](https://prosopo.io/) API server-side to verify the CAPTCHA response.

Please review the [Prosopo Privacy Policy](https://prosopo.io/privacy-policy/) and [Terms and Conditions](https://prosopo.io/terms-and-conditions/) to fully understand data handling practices.
