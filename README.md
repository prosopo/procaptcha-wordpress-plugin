## Prosopo Procaptcha Integration for WordPress

Welcome to the GitHub repository for
the [Prosopo Procaptcha Integration for WordPress](https://wordpress.org/plugins/prosopo-procaptcha/)!

This repository serves as a GitHub mirror of
the [official WordPress SVN repository](http://plugins.svn.wordpress.org/prosopo-procaptcha/), designed to streamline
community collaboration and contributions.

We ensure this repository is kept up-to-date with the latest version. Feel free to open issues or submit pull requests
directly here ‚Äî any changes made will be included in the next official release.

## 1. Installation

The plugin is distributed via the official WordPress Plugin
Repository: [Prosopo Procaptcha](https://wordpress.org/plugins/prosopo-procaptcha/).

To install manually you'll need to clone the repository and build the assets:

1. `git clone git@github.com:prosopo/procaptcha-wordpress-plugin.git .`
2. `cd assets; corepack use yarn@latest; yarn build:all`
2. Now you can copy the `prosopo-procaptcha` directory and add it to your local WordPress installation by placing it in
   the `wp-content/plugins` folder.
